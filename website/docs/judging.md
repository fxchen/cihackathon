## Round 1

Each of you will receive an emailed link to judge either CNC, speech, speech in noise, or music entries using a survey platform. In Round 1 you will be asked to rank each entry on a scale of 1-10.

## Round 2

Each of you will receive an emailed link to judge either CNC, speech, speech in noise, or music entries using a survey platform. In Round 2 you will be asked to listen to two entries and choose the better of the two until there is a clear winner for that subset of sounds.

## Review by team and code review

Top teams for each category will be notified, and a code review with the top 5 teams overall will take place with the event organizers.
