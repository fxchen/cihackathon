## Round 1

In Round 1, you will judge 10 teams' submissions in all categories. You will be asked to rank each entry on a scale of 1-10, with 1 representing unintelligible noise and 10 representing sound as heard without a cochlear implant.

## Round 2

In Round 2, you will be asked to listen to two entries and choose the better of the two, for a subset of entries in all categories.

## Review by team and code review

Top teams for each category will be notified, and a code review with the top teams will take place with the event organizers.
