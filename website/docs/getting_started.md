**Learn**
Read or watch our presentations to get up to speed on how cochlear implants work, how to participate, and what resources are available to you.

**Register**
Register your team to participate in the hackathon, or just register to judge hackers' entries. 

**Hack**
1. Download base code in Matlab or Python. Find all code from our [Code page](https://ci-hackathon.squarespace.com/code)

2. Edit the code (or create your own!) to improve the auditory output. Work in Matlab, Python, or any other language you want. 

3. Run your output matrix through our vocoder (in Python or Matlab).

3. Listen to your audio output as it would sound through a cochlear implant.
