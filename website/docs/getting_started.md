## Register

Register your team to participate in the hackathon, or simply register to judge hackers' entries. 

## Learn

Read or watch our presentations to get up to speed on how cochlear implants work, how to participate, and what resources are available to you.

## Hack

1. Download base code in Matlab or Python. Find all code from our Code section.

2. Edit the code (or create your own!) to improve the auditory output. Work in Matlab, Python, or any other language you want. 

3. Test your algorithm on our acoustic inputs.

4. Run your output matrix through our vocoder (in Python or Matlab).

5. Listen to your audio output as it would sound through a cochlear implant.
