**Instructions**

1. Download base code in Matlab or Python Find all code from our [Code page](https://ci-hackathon.squarespace.com/code)

2. Edit the code (or create your own!) to improve the outputWork in Matlab, Python, or any other language you want. You will submit 4 matrices as .csv files for judging.

3. Listen to your audio output as it would sound through a cochlear implantRun our vocoder (in Python or Matlab) by inputting the matrix you generated from the original sound

4. Submit your entries.

mp3 source audio files will be uploaded here on Sunday, May 29th.

Download these files (one each of music, CNC words, natural speech, and speech in noise)

Run them through your code: your output file is a matrix of elecs x time

Save these output matrices separately as .csv files, labeled as [teamname]\_cnc.csv, [teamname]\_speech.csv, [teamname]\_noise.csv, [teamname]\_music.csv

Attach all 4 files in one email and send to CIHackathon2020@gmail.com.
