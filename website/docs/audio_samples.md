Performance will be judged on one stimulus from each of the following categories. The exact audio samples to be judged will be released on the day of submission.

### Natural Speech

Natural speech is the stimulus that most cochlear implants target with their algorithms.

### Consonant-Nucleus-Consonant (CNC) Words

CNC words are commonly used to judge CI performance.

### Speech in Noise

One of the hardest things for CI users is a noisy environment, so distinguishing speech in noise is an important milestone for improvement.

### Music

Cochlear implant users usually do not enjoy music to the same extent as prior to implant. An improvement in music processing would greatly improve CI usersâ€™ experience.
